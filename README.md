# Google Fit Sync

This is a basic implementation of Google Fit API that reads blood pressure values (systolic and diastolic) and displays them in a recycler view. It also manages the user permissions Work-Flow.

The readings are from the last month and the display value is the average number for that day (see Buckets documentation). Improvements can be made.
